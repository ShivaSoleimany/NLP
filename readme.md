This project aims to work on phrase-based sentence paraphrasing. 
For this goal we build on the previous endeavors in the two projects mentioned below:

1)Constrained Sentence Generation via Metropolis-Hastings Sampling 
 https://github.com/NingMiao/CGMH
 
 2)Stochastic Wasserstein Autoencoder for Probabilistic Sentence Generation
 https://github.com/HareeshBahuleyan/probabilistic_nlg
